# CodeLou_FrontEnd

## Description
```
The project is hosted at http://www.heybear64.com.  You can also copy all files
and folders as is to your device and click on index.html to view.  An Internet
connection is needed for Bill Murray section. 
You can also read more information about the site on the about page.
There is no specific theme to the website.  It just demonstrate various coding items.
The book of Remy, well i just like the way the pages turn.  
When your holding and turning the page, moving the page in different
ways the page stays in tact.  It's impressive.  

The Android programming section was just something a little personal.  
I enlarged the picture on hover and when clicked it
initiates a lightbox which is basically a slideshow and modal put together.

Then there's Bill Murray from Flicker.  
I liked the Ajax request and Jason response in this function so I wanted to
keep an example of itfor further reference.
