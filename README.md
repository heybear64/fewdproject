# CodeLou_FrontEnd

## Description
```
The project is hosted at http://www.heybear64.com.  You can also read more information about the site on the about page.
There is no specific theme to the website.  It just demonstrate various coding items.
The book of Remy, well i just like the way the pages turn.  When your holding and turning the page, moving the page in different
ways the page stays in tact.  It's impressive.  

The Android programming section was just something a little personal.  I enlarged the picture on hover and when clicked
initiates a lightbox which is basically a slideshow and model put together.

Then there's Bill Murray from Flicker.  I liked the Ajax request and Jason response in this function so I wanted to keep an example of it
for further reference.

The class(es) I created are:



1. class name ( .regtext )
.. what class does ( modifies text for <p> tag.  Changes color, font-size, line height )

2. class name ( .inline2)
`` what class does (  modifies <p> tag defaults. Changes display from block to inline and font-size)

3. ID name ( #hrshort )

... more created classes in main.css under comments:
/* minor adjustments to infrequent items*/
/* photos-Chacheet */




## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions I created are:

1. function name ( $('button').click(function () )
.. what function does ( determines which button has been pressed based on text of button and evaluates what to do based on button.)

2. API name ( flickerAPI )
.. what API does ( not setup in specific function.  Modified and setup to run when the JavaScript
  is loaded to auto request and populate Bill Murray feed.)

3.   function name ( function validateemail(inputText) )
.. what function does ( validates email address and pop up alert on if it is valid or not);

4. API name ( turnjs )
